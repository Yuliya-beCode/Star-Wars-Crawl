    <h1>A long time ago</h1>

</div>
<p> I have started my coding program 2 weeks ago and I am very proud to be here,  among all the talented and cooperative people. </p>
       
<p>At the beginning of the course, it was a little bit difficult to resolve all the technical troubles such as installing Ubuntu and Virtual Box… </p>

<p>But at the and of the first beCode week you can already be proud of yourself because you have fond all the solutions and feel very comfortable with the technical issues.  </p>

<p>In the case of questions we can always ask our coaches. They are very cooperative and happy to help us. </p>

<p>That’s a good feeling that after 2 weeks I can contribute to one of GitHub’ branches and create a repository.  </p>
